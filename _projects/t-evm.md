Traditional elections satisfy neither citizens nor political authorities in recent years. They are not fully secure since it is easy to attack votes. It also threatens privacy and transparency of voters. Additionally, it takes too much time to count the votes. 

We propose a Blockchain based solution for solving various problems faced in the voting process. This project is a simple attemmpt to design and build an electronic voting system; where we make use of *Solidity Smart Contracts* to create a decentralized voting application (DApp). 


Our implementation consists of a web interface to allow user to interact with the blockchain, rest api to handle required records of data. For a private blockchain, we've used go-based Ethereum implementation-[geth]().

This project is inspired by [this paper](https://skemman.is/bitstream/1946/31161/1/Research-Paper-BBEVS.pdf).
