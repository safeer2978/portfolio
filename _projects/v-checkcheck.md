The application aims to increase the productivity of the user by organizing daily and monthly tasks into doable subtasks and by providing a clean, smooth and responsive User Interface, to ensure the user doesnâ€™t waste time setting up the application and focuses on doing the tasks

This application was built as part of the Java Programming course at SIT by [`safeer2978`](https://github.com/safeer2978) and [`imNachi`](https://github.com/imNachi). This is an android app written in java, thus an ideal choice for a capstone project for illustrating JAVA skills.
