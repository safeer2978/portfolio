title: About me
---

I'm passionate about technology and learning new things.
I'm softspoken and very patient.
I've been part of several teams, as a leader, as a follower and mentor.
I'm a compassionate and responsible individual, who not only takes action when the situation demands it but also adapt to changing situations.

I aspire to be a Software Engineer. I'm skilled in Java and Python.

My favorite part about development is the fact when ideas that were just on a piece of paper or a document, turn into something that's real and it exists.
